# Experiments_Under_Unity
This repository contains a lot of scene based on different experiments under Unity. 3D, logic, algorithmic, etc.

Current scene and content:
01_Clock ==> Contains a clock (with hands) that can be analog
02_ConstructingFractal ==> Create a rotating fractal
03_FramesPerSecond ==> Create a FPS counter by launching spheres against themselves
04_ObjectsPool ==> Create a fountain of stuff. Each stuff are stored in a pool when no more needed. Instead of instantiate new gameobjects, the object from the pool are used again.

NextStep:
02_ConstructingFractal : 
	- Add a regenerate function
	- Add a configuration panel
	- Make each branch grows instead of just spawning
